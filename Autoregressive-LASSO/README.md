# Time-Series Forecasting using Autoregressive LASSO
This folder contains files used for my time-series forecasting exercise using an autoregressive LASSO model. In this exercise, I demonstrate how to create a lagged time-series dataset, how to fit an Autoregressive LASSO model using this lagged dataset, and how to use this fitted model for forecasting. In addition, I also show how to determine the best lambda (log-lambda) value that results in the model with the best, predictive power. BibTeX is also used to cite my sources. 

## About the files

- [autoregressive-lasso.Rmd](): This is the R-markdown file used to turn my R code into a document.
- [autoregressive-lasso.pdf](): The document outlining how to forecast using an Autoregressive LASSO Model. 
- [dataset.csv](): Quarterly series of the U.S. Industrial Production Index (1970 Q1-2019Q2)
- [cite.bib](): BibTeX file used for my citations.
