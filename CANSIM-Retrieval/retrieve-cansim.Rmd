# Introduction
\indent 
This paper is is an example on how to manipulate CANSIM data from Statistics Canada. Three R packages are used in this demonstration: `tidyverse`, `cansim`, and `writexl`. The `cansim` package is very useful in retrieving data tables and time-series from Canada's socioeconomic repository, CANSIM. The `tidyverse` package is a collection of R packages designed for data science^[For more information, see https://www.tidyverse.org/]. Lastly, `writexl` is a package that is used to export the dataframes in '.xlsx' format. In this demonstration, I will be using the Consumer Price Index, monthly, not seasonally adjusted^[Statistics Canada. Table 18-10-0004-01 Consumer Price Index, monthly, not seasonally adjusted].

# Importing Packages
\indent 
The relevant packages are loaded using the `library()` function. It is important to set up a file cache using the `options()` function. Although this step is optional, it is highly recommended as it would speed up data retrieval. This is because the `cansim` package will cache the data in a temporary directory for the duration of the R session. 
```{r import, eval=FALSE}
# import packages
library(cansim)
library(tidyverse) 
library(writexl)
```

```{r importtrue, include=FALSE}
library(cansim)
library(tidyverse) 
library(writexl)
```

```{r optionscache, echo=TRUE}
options(cansim.cache_path = "StatCan4R") # Set-up File Cache
```

# List of Vectors
\indent 
Next, is to search for the relevant data. Statistics Canada data are accessed by using vector identifiers. This is because retrieving by table number as the package will load the entire package, putting an excessive demand on RAM and slowing down the retrieval process. Searching the desired vectors is done by using the [**Statistics Canada Data Search Tool**](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data). 

To find the correct vector identifier(s), enter the table number in the "Keyword(s)" field. Then click the matching StatCan table in the search results. Then click on Add/Remove data to select which specific dimensions and customize the data. It is important to be specific and check the right boxes when customizing the table as this yields the desired vector identifier(s). I customized the data table by CPI All-items, and in the four provinces across Western Canada. Copy the relevant identifiers and paste them to a vector object.

![Search by table number](StatCanKeyword.jpg){width=75% }

![Click Add/Remove data](StatCanAddRemove.jpg){width=75% }

![Check 'Display Vector indentifier and coordinate'](StatCanVector.jpg){width=75% }

In the section of code below, the necessary vector identifiers are assigned into a vector object in R. Second, the desired start and end periods are defined. Next I use the `get_cansim_vector()` to retrieve the necessary tables. Lastly, the variable names in the dataframe are changed and the irrelevant columns are dropped.
```{r vectors, eval=FALSE}
# assign the vector identifiers into a vector
vectors.cpi <- c("v41692055",
                 "v41692191",
                 "v41692327",
                 "v41692462")
date.start <- "2000-01-01" # start period
date.end <- "2020-09-01" # end period
# retrieve tables using the vector
df <- get_cansim_vector(vectors.cpi, date.start, date.end) %>% # start and end dates 
      rename(CPIallitems = VALUE) %>% # rename variables; rename VALUE into CPIallitems
      rename(date = REF_DATE) %>% 
      rename(vector = VECTOR) %>% 
      select(-c(1, 4:8)) # drop the irrelevant variables. 
```

# Spreading the Data
\indent 
Although I have shown how to retrieve StatCan data using the `cansim` package, The `get_cansim_vector()` does not return a tidy data. Data points by vector indentifiers are piled on top of one another. To address this, the code below shows how to spread the data using the `spread()` function. This clean data is then exported as a '.xlsx' file. 

Next, I use the `get_cansim_vector_info()` function to get the information about vectors. I use a for loop to repalce the vector names in the dataframe with their appropriate english names. 
```{r spread, eval=FALSE}
# get information about vectors
title.vectors <- get_cansim_vector_info(x) %>%
        select(-c(1,3:4,6:10)) # get the titles
for (i in 1:length(x)){ # rename vectors with their recognized titles;
  # replace vector numbers with actual names; 
  # match vector with the appropriate titles.
  df[df==title.vectors$VECTOR[i]] <- title.vectors$title_en[i] 
  }
df <- spread(df, key=vector, value=CPIallitems) # spread the dataframe
write_xlsx(df , path="StatCan4R\CPI-all-items.xlsx") # export data
```

# Full Implementation using a Function
\indent 
The code below is a full implementation, but with a function. Functions are very useful to perform specific tasks. First, I used an if-else statement to check if the vector is not a NULL type object. After using the `get_cansim_vector()` for retrieval and selection of useful information, I used a for loop to rename the vectors into more informative names. Then the data is spread using the `spread()` function. It is important to note that when creating a vector of names to replace the original identifiers, they have to match the order of their vector identifiers.

```{r function, eval=FALSE}
date.start <- "2000-01-01" # start period
date.end <- "2020-09-01" # end period
# function for importing the necessary vectors
query <- function(x, date1, date2){
  if (is.null(x) != TRUE){# if list of vectors is not NULL (empty) 
    if ((is.null(date1) != TRUE) && (is.null(date2) != TRUE)){# if dates are not NULL (empty) 
      df <- get_cansim_vector(x, "2000-01-01", "2019-12-01") %>% # start and end dates 
        rename(value = VALUE) %>% # rename variables
        rename(date = REF_DATE) %>% 
        rename(vector = VECTOR) %>% 
        select(-c(1, 4:8)) # drop the irrelevant variables.
      title.vectors <- get_cansim_vector_info(x) %>%
        select(-c(1,3:4,6:10)) # get the titles
      for (i in 1:length(x)){
        # replace vector numbers with actual names; 
        # match vector with the appropriate english title
        df[df==title.vectors$VECTOR[i]] <- title.vectors$title_en[i] 
      }
      df <- spread(df, key=vector, value=value) # spread the dataframe
      return(df) # return dataframe
    }
    else{ # warning statement that says inputs are not valid; 'stop' halts execution of code.
      stop("Please enter appropriate start and end dates.")
    }
  }
  else{
    stop("Your inputs are not valid. Please use a list of CANSIM vectors or a vector.")
  }
}
df <- query(vectors.cpi, date.start, date.start)
write_xlsx(df, path="StatCan4R\CPI-all-items.xlsx") # export data
```

# Conclusion
\indent 
I have shown how to retrieve, manipulate and clean the data from StatsCan using three libraries: `cansim`, `tidyverse`, and `writexl`. The Data Enthusiast's Blog and the `cansim` package reference guide have been been very helpful to me in creating this demonstration.
